# ML learning material
A messy compilaitons of links I found useful, or popular with people around me while learning ML.

## introduction courses

## great videos
- ml / math concepts: https://www.youtube.com/@statquest
- https://www.youtube.com/@howardjeremyp
- 3blue1brown has so many great videos, e.g. [eigenvectors & eigenvalues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g)

## great blogs
- Lilian Weng's https://lilianweng.github.io/

## tools and libraries
- tensor manipulation: [einops](https://einops.rocks/) or [einx](https://github.com/fferflo/einx) and [eindex](https://pypi.org/project/eindex/)
- libraries for jupyter: [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) https://youtu.be/9Q6sLbz37gk
- diff for jupyter: https://www.reviewnb.com/
- tensordict: https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict
- transformerlens: https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens
- circuitsvis: https://github.com/alan-cooney/CircuitsVis
- transformer debugger: https://github.com/openai/transformer-debugger
- weights and biases (logging/dashboard for training runs as a service): https://wandb.ai/
- read math: (recognize symbols by drawing them) https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html
- visualize math equations: https://www.desmos.com/calculator
- understand floating point numbers https://float.exposed
- using `??` after a function/method in a jupyter notebook show the source code

## challenges
- prompt injection CTF: https://hackmerlin.io/

## building intuitions
- transformers: thinking of residual stream as "superposition" a way to force the network to compress (from this source and it has many good gems but it's very long https://youtu.be/KV5gbOmHbjU)
- unsupervised learning: framing unsupervised learning as distribution matching, intelligence as compression (pretty long too but really mind expanding to me https://youtu.be/AKMuA_TVz3A)
